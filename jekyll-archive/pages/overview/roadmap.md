## In progress

Contributor availability is difficult to predict, so we try not to make commitments about when (or whether)
a particular feature will get implemented.  That said, here's some areas which people are actively working on:

<!-- things we expect to get to sooner go at the top -->

- Create a Heft plugin for StorybookJS
- Upgrade the Jest package used by Heft
- Upgrade the baseline TypeScript version to be 4.x
- Set up a [rushstack-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack-samples/) repo with fully worked out projects
  illustrating realistic usage patterns
- Share samples for using ReactNative with Rush+PNPM
- [Multi-project watch mode](https://rushjs.io/pages/advanced/watch_mode/) for Rush
- Working towards a 1.0 release of Heft, to stabilize the config file and plugin API contracts


## Soon, hopefully

The Rush Stack maintainers currently see these feature areas as the main priorities for upcoming investments:

<!-- things we expect to get to sooner go at the top -->

- Multiphase builds for Rush
- Improve the design of Rush publishing (`rush publish`, `rush version`, `rush change`)


If there's a specific area that's important to you, let us know in the
[Zulip chat room](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/).
And of course, even if a feature isn't listed on the road map, pull requests are always welcome!
