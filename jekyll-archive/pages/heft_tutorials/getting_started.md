This walkthrough will get you started with Heft by creating a basic Node.js console project.

> [heft-node-basic-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack-samples/tree/main/heft/heft-node-basic-tutorial)
> and [heft-webpack-basic-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack-samples/tree/main/heft/heft-webpack-basic-tutorial)
> folders illustrate a fully worked out example of a simple project that builds using Heft.

We'll begin by creating a simple standalone project without Rush.  (Later, the [Interfacing with Rush]({% link pages/heft_tutorials/heft_and_rush.md %}) tutorial will examine what's different when using Heft in a monorepo.)

1. We'll use the [PNPM package manager](https://pnpm.js.org/) for this demo.  (Its command line is very similar to NPM, so you can substitute `npm` for `pnpm` in these steps.)  There are [various ways](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation.html) to install PNPM, but the simplest is like this:

    ```shell
    $ npm install --global pnpm
    ```

2. Create a new folder **my-app** with a **package.json** file for our project, like this:

    **my-app/package.json**
    ```
    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A Heft tutorial project",
      "license": "MIT",
      "main": "lib/start.js",
      "typings": "lib/start.d.ts",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node lib/start.js"
      }
    }
    ```

3. Create a TypeScript source file that we'll compile.

    **my-app/src/start.ts**
    ```
    console.log("Hello, world!");
    ```

4. Install [@rushstack/heft](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rushstack/heft) and [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) as `devDependenices` for your project:

    ```shell
    $ cd my-app
    $ pnpm install --save-dev @rushstack/heft
    $ pnpm install --save-dev typescript

    # Since this project will use the console.log() API, we also need to add the TypeScript
    # typings for Node.js.  Typings should always use "--save-exact" version specifiers.
    $ pnpm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/node
    ```

5. Next we need to create the TypeScript [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) file.  The presence of this file causes Heft to invoke the TypeScript compiler.  For now we'll create a simple standalone **tsconfig.json** file; later we'll demonstrate how to share a reusable configuration across many projects.

    **my-app/tsconfig.json**
    ```js
    {
      "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",

      "compilerOptions": {
        "outDir": "lib",
        "rootDirs": ["src/"],

        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
        "declaration": true,
        "sourceMap": true,
        "declarationMap": true,
        "inlineSources": true,
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "types": ["node"],

        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "es2017",
        "lib": ["es2017"]
      },
      "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
      "exclude": ["node_modules", "lib"]
    }
    ```

    Note that `"types": ["node"]` references the `@types/node` package that we installed above.  This is needed
    because Node.js is a global environment, so its typings must be loaded globally.  Most other `@types` packages
    can be loaded via `import` statements in your source code.

    See the [typescript task]({% link pages/heft_tasks/typescript.md %}) documentation for more background about
    TypeScript configuration with Heft.

6.  You can invoke Heft using `./node_modules/.bin/heft`, but it's more convenient to install it globally
    so that it's always available in your shell `PATH`:

    ```shell
    # Install the Heft tool globally
    $ pnpm install --global @rushstack/heft
    ```

    > What if the globally installed `heft` binary is the wrong version?
    >
    > Just like Rush, Heft implements a "version selector" feature that will automatically
    > discover your local `node_modules` folder and invoke `./node_modules/.bin/heft`, ensuring
    > that the correct version is used.

7. Let's try manually invoking Heft's [command line]({% link pages/heft/cli.md %}) to build our project.

    ```shell
    # For Windows, use backslashes for all these commands

    # Make sure we're in your project folder
    $ cd my-app

    # View the command line help
    $ heft --help
    $ heft build --help

    # Build the project
    $ heft build

    # To see more detail about what Heft is doing, add you can the "--verbose" flag
    $ heft build --verbose
    ```

    Invoking `heft build` should produce console output like this:

    ```
    Project build folder is "/path/to/my-app"
    Starting build
    ---- Compile started ----
    [copy-static-assets] Copied 0 static assets in 0ms
    [typescript] Using TypeScript version 3.9.7
    ---- Compile finished (1494ms) ----
    ---- Bundle started ----
    ---- Bundle finished (0ms) ----
    -------------------- Finished (2.408s) --------------------
    Project: my-app@1.0.0
    Heft version: 0.3.0
    Node version: v12.17.0
    ```

    > Some terminology:  When we invoke the `heft build` command from the shell, the "build" verb is called an **action**.  Actions are user interface concepts, sort of like macros.  The action causes Heft to invoke multiple **tasks** such as `[typescript]` or `[copy-static-assets]`.  These tasks often run in parallel.  The tasks are grouped into **stages** such as "Compile" and "Bundle" in the above log.  Stages represent major steps of the overall operation.  These concepts are explained in more depth in the [Heft architecture]({% link pages/heft/architecture.md %}) article.

    After the build finishes, confirm that it produced several output files in your `lib` folder:
    - **start.js** - the compiled JavaScript code
    - **start.d.ts** - the TypeScript typings, for external libraries that might import this module
    - **start.js.map** and **start.d.ts.map** - Source map files, which enable tools like debuggers to find the corresponding source code file/line, for a given item in an output file

    &nbsp;

8. If you recall, our **package.json** file has a `"scripts"` section that specifies `"start": "node lib/start.js"`.  Let's try running the compiled code using `pnpm run`.

    ```shell
    # Invoke the "start" script from package.json
    $ pnpm run start

    # If you have Rush installed, you can also use this slightly shorter equivalent
    $ rushx start
    ```

    You should see output like this:
    ```
    > my-app@1.0.0 start C:\my-app
    > node lib/start.js

    Hello, world!
    ```

9. We can also add a `"build"` script to our **package.json** file:

    **my-app/package.json**
    ```
    {
      . . .
      "scripts": {
        "build": "heft build --clean",
        "start": "node lib/start.js"
      },
      . . .
    }
    ```

    With this change, you can also build by invoking `pnpm run build` (or `rushx build`).  This toolchain-agnostic
    convention makes it easier for newcomers to guess how to build your project.  It will also be useful later when
    we integrate with Rush.

10. To complete this project, we need to create one more config file to ensure that `heft clean` properly deletes the output files:

    **my-app/config/heft.json**
    ```
    /**
     * Defines configuration used by core Heft.
     */
    {
      "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/heft/heft.schema.json",

      "eventActions": [
        {
          /**
           * The kind of built-in operation that should be performed.
           * The "deleteGlobs" action deletes files or folders that match the
           * specified glob patterns.
           */
          "actionKind": "deleteGlobs",

          /**
           * The stage of the Heft run during which this action should occur. Note that actions specified in heft.json
           * occur at the end of the stage of the Heft run.
           */
          "heftEvent": "clean",

          /**
           * A user-defined tag whose purpose is to allow configs to replace/delete handlers that were added by other
           * configs.
           */
          "actionId": "defaultClean",

          /**
           * Glob patterns to be deleted. The paths are resolved relative to the project folder.
           */
          "globsToDelete": ["dist", "lib", "temp"]
        }
      ],

      /**
       * The list of Heft plugins to be loaded.
       */
      "heftPlugins": [
        // {
        //  /**
        //   * The path to the plugin package.
        //   */
        //  "plugin": "path/to/my-plugin",
        //
        //  /**
        //   * An optional object that provides additional settings that may be defined by the plugin.
        //   */
        //  // "options": { }
        // }
      ]
    }
    ```
