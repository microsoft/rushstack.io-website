## StderrLineTransform class

`StderrLineTransform` normalizes lines that mix characters from `stdout` and `stderr`<!-- -->, so that each output line is routed entirely to `stdout` or `stderr`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class StderrLineTransform extends TerminalTransform 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [TerminalTransform](./terminal.terminaltransform.md)

## Remarks

IMPORTANT: This transform assumes that its input has been normalized to use `"\n"` newlines.

IMPORTANT: This transform does not produce realtime output, because lines are buffered until a newline character is encountered.

Suppose that a poorly behaved process produces output like this:

```ts
process.stderr.write('An error occurred, cleaning up');
process.stdout.write('.'); // (delay)
process.stdout.write('.'); // (delay)
process.stdout.write('.');
process.stdout.write('\n');
process.stderr.write('The process completed with errors\n');

```
When `stdout` and `stderr` are combined on the console, the mistake in the output would not be noticeable:

```
An error occurred, cleaning up...
The process completed with errors

```
However, if we discard `stdout`<!-- -->, then `stderr` is malformed:

```
An error occurred, cleaning upThe process completed with errors

```
Tooling scripts can introduce these sorts of problems via edge cases that are difficult to find and fix.

`StderrLineTransform` normalizes the output so that if a combined line contains any `stderr` characters, then the entire line is routed to `stderr`<!-- -->. Later, if we discard `stdout`<!-- -->, then the output will preserve the appropriate context:

```
An error occurred, cleaning up...
The process completed with errors

```
