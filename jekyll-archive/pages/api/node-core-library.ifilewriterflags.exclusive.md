## IFileWriterFlags.exclusive property

Fails if path exists. The exclusive flag ensures that path is newly created.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
exclusive?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

On POSIX-like operating systems, path is considered to exist even if it is a symlink to a non-existent file. The exclusive flag may or may not work with network file systems.
