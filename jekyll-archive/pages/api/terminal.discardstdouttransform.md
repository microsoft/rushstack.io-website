## DiscardStdoutTransform class

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

`DiscardStdoutTransform` discards `stdout` chunks while fixing up malformed `stderr` lines.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class DiscardStdoutTransform extends TerminalTransform 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [TerminalTransform](./terminal.terminaltransform.md)

## Remarks

Suppose that a poorly behaved process produces output like this:

```ts
process.stdout.write('Starting operation...\n');
process.stderr.write('An error occurred');
process.stdout.write('\nFinishing up\n');
process.stderr.write('The process completed with errors\n');

```
When `stdout` and `stderr` are combined on the console, the mistake in the output would not be noticeable:

```
Starting operation...
An error occurred
Finishing up
The process completed with errors

```
However, if we discard `stdout`<!-- -->, then `stderr` is missing a newline:

```
An error occurredThe process completed with errors

```
Tooling scripts can introduce these sorts of problems via edge cases that are difficult to find and fix. `DiscardStdoutTransform` can discard the `stdout` stream and fix up `stderr`<!-- -->:

```
An error occurred
The process completed with errors

```
