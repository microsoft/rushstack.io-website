## CompileSubstageHooks.afterRecompile property

The `afterRecompile` event is only used in watch mode. It fires whenever the compiler's outputs have been rebuilt. The initial compilation fires the `afterCompile` event only, and then all subsequent iterations fire the `afterRecompile` event only. Heft does not wait for the `afterRecompile` promises to resolve.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly afterRecompile: AsyncParallelHook;
```
