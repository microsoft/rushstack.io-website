## IConfigApiReport.reportFolder property

Specifies the folder where the API report file is written. The file name portion is determined by the `reportFileName` setting.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
reportFolder?: string;
```

## Remarks

The API report file is normally tracked by Git. Changes to it can be used to trigger a branch policy, e.g. for an API review.

The path is resolved relative to the folder of the config file that contains the setting; to change this, prepend a folder token such as `<projectFolder>`<!-- -->.
