An event handler that is called when a [CollatedWriter](./stream-collator.collatedwriter.md) becomes output, before any of its chunks have been written to the destination.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
onWriterActive?: (writer: CollatedWriter) => void;
```

## Remarks

Each `CollatedWriter` object will become active exactly once before the `StreamCollator` completes.
