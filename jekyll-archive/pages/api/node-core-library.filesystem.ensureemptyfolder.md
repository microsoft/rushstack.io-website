## FileSystem.ensureEmptyFolder() method

Deletes the content of a folder, but not the folder itself. Also ensures the folder exists. Behind the scenes it uses `fs-extra.emptyDirSync()`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static ensureEmptyFolder(folderPath: string): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  folderPath | string | The absolute or relative path to the folder which should have its contents deleted. |

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

This is a workaround for a common race condition, where the virus scanner holds a lock on the folder for a brief period after it was deleted, causing EBUSY errors for any code that tries to recreate the folder.
