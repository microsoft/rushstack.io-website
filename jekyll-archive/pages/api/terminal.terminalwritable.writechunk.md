## TerminalWritable.writeChunk() method

Upstream objects call this method to provide inputs to this object.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
/** @sealed */
writeChunk(chunk: ITerminalChunk): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  chunk | [ITerminalChunk](./terminal.iterminalchunk.md) |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

The subclass provides its implementation via the the [TerminalWritable.onWriteChunk()](./terminal.terminalwritable.onwritechunk.md) method, which is called by `writeChunk()`<!-- -->.

The object that calls `writeChunk()` must call `close()` when it is finished; failing to do so may introduce a resource leak, or may prevent some buffered data from being written.
