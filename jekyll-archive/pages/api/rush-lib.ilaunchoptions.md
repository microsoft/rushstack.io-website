## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [alreadyReportedNodeTooNewError?](./rush-lib.ilaunchoptions.alreadyreportednodetoonewerror.md) | boolean | <i>(Optional)</i> If true, the wrapper process already printed a warning that the version of Node.js hasn't been tested with this version of Rush, so we shouldn't print a similar error. |
|  [isManaged](./rush-lib.ilaunchoptions.ismanaged.md) | boolean | True if the tool was invoked from within a project with a rush.json file, otherwise false. We consider a project without a rush.json to be "unmanaged" and we'll print that to the command line when the tool is executed. This is mainly used for debugging purposes. |
