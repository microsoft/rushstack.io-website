## IConfigApiReport.reportTempFolder property

Specifies the folder where the temporary report file is written. The file name portion is determined by the `reportFileName` setting.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
reportTempFolder?: string;
```

## Remarks

After the temporary file is written to disk, it is compared with the file in the `reportFolder`<!-- -->. If they are different, a production build will fail.

The path is resolved relative to the folder of the config file that contains the setting; to change this, prepend a folder token such as `<projectFolder>`<!-- -->.
