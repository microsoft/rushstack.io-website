## Remarks

This bitfield corresponds to the "mode\_t" structure described in this document: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys\_stat.h.html

It is used with NodeJS APIs such as fs.Stat.mode and fs.chmodSync(). These values represent a set of permissions and can be combined using bitwise arithmetic.
