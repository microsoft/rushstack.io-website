[Home](./index.md) &gt; [@rushstack/tree-pattern](./tree-pattern.md) &gt; [TreeNode](./tree-pattern.treenode.md)

## TreeNode type

Indicates the tree-like data structure that [TreePattern](./tree-pattern.treepattern.md) will traverse.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type TreeNode = any;
```

## Remarks

Since `TreePattern` makes relatively few assumptions object the object structure, this is just an alias for `any`<!-- -->. At least as far as the portions to be matched, the tree nodes are expected to be JSON-like structures made from JavaScript arrays, JavaScript objects, and primitive values that can be compared using `===`<!-- -->.
