## Rush.launch() method

This API is used by the `@microsoft/rush` front end to launch the "rush" command-line. Third-party tools should not use this API. Instead, they should execute the "rush" binary and start a new Node.js process.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static launch(launcherVersion: string, arg: ILaunchOptions): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  launcherVersion | string | The version of the <code>@microsoft/rush</code> wrapper used to call invoke the CLI. |
|  arg | [ILaunchOptions](./rush-lib.ilaunchoptions.md) |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

Earlier versions of the rush frontend used a different API contract. In the old contract, the second argument was the `isManaged` value of the [ILaunchOptions](./rush-lib.ilaunchoptions.md) object.

Even though this API isn't documented, it is still supported for legacy compatibility.
