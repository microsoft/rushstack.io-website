## ExtractorConfig.skipLibCheck property

This option causes the compiler to be invoked with the `--skipLibCheck` option.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly skipLibCheck: boolean;
```

## Remarks

This option is not recommended and may cause API Extractor to produce incomplete or incorrect declarations, but it may be required when dependencies contain declarations that are incompatible with the TypeScript engine that API Extractor uses for its analysis. Where possible, the underlying issue should be fixed rather than relying on skipLibCheck.
