## FileWriter.close() method

Closes the file handle permanently. No operations can be made on this file handle after calling this. Behind the scenes it uses `fs.closeSync()` and releases the file descriptor to be re-used.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
close(): void;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

The `close()` method can be called more than once; additional calls are ignored.
